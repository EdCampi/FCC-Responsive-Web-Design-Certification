    <p id="text" class="tribute">King was born Michael King Jr. on January 15, 1929, in Atlanta, Georgia, the second of three children to the Reverend Michael King Sr. and Alberta King (née Williams). During a trip trhough Europe, in 1934, his father decided to change their names for Martin Luther in admiration for Martin Luther, a german professor of theology, composer, priest, Agustinian monk and a seminal figure in the Protestant Reformation.</p>
    <p class="tribute">Martin Luther King, Jr. was a social activist and Baptist minister who played a key role in the American civil rights movement from the mid-1950s until his assassination in 1968. King sought equality and human rights for African Americans, the economically disadvantaged and all victims of injustice through peaceful protest. He was the driving force behind watershed events such as the Montgomery Bus Boycott and the 1963 March on Washington, which helped bring about such landmark legislation as the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act.</p>
    <p class="tribute">At the age of thirty-five, Martin Luther King, Jr., was the youngest man to have received the Nobel Peace Prize. When notified of his selection, he announced that he would turn over the prize money of $54,123 to the furtherance of the civil rights movement.</p>
  <p class="tribute">On the evening of April 4, 1968, while standing on the balcony of his motel room in Memphis, Tennessee, where he was to lead a protest march in sympathy with striking garbage workers of that city, he was assassinated.</p>
<p class="tribute">Martin Luther King is remembered each year on Martin Luther King, Jr. Day (third Monday of each January), a U.S. federal holiday since 1986.</p>
